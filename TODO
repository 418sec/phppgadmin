Tables
------

* Not using proper attFields array for attribute info
* Browse doesn't implement paging

Functions
---------

* we add a {} around function definitions every time they are saved to the
database. This doesn't break anything, but is annoying after you done it 5 times
and have 5 pairs in your function.

* need to add a drop link to the properties and edit pages.
