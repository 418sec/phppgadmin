PHPPGADMIN TODO LIST FOR DEVELOPERS
-----------------------------------

phpPgAdmin is an open source project which means that if you see something on 
this list that you would like to implement, just send us a patch.  You can find
our project page here:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/phppgadmin/

An item is marked 'claimed' when a username in brackets is put after the TODO
item.

An item is marked with a '-' if it has been completed.

Users
-----

* 7.3 user variables (eg. ALTER USER SET .. TO ...)

Groups
------

* Alter group

Permissions

* Allow revoking of perms
* Allow display of grants for a user
* Allow display of grants for a group

Databases
---------

* Fix failure to drop database even tho seemingly no-one is connected to it
* Add alter database for 7.3+
* Dump database using pg_dump streaming

Tables

* Vacuum & analyze (half done)

Views

Functions
---------

* Browse function (set-returning-functions only)

Indexes 
-------

* Partial indexes
* Functional indexes

Types
-----

* Support new 7.3 anonymous composite types

Operators
---------

* Unimplemented

Operator Classes
----------------

* Unimplemented

Triggers
--------

* Alter trigger (7.3+) (eg. rename trigger)

Aggregates
----------

* Unimplemented

Languages
---------

* Unimplemented
* Note: Are not in schemas in 7.3 - they are database-wide

Domains (7.3)
-------------

* Unimplemented.  They do appear as normal types though.

Conversions (7.3)
-----------------

* Some functions implemented in 73
* No interface done

Casts (7.3)
-----------

* Unimplemented

Settings
--------

* Postgres 7.3 returns SHOW ALL as a proper result set - makes it easy to do a phpMyAdmin style 'view settings'.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Exotic
------

* Support contrib/tsearch for easy full text indexes
* Search for object feature

Principles
----------

* register_globals off support
* maximum error_reporting support - enforces code quality, reduces bugs and 
  improves security
* PHP 4.2 features used
* No HTML font, colour, layout tags.  Use CSS for everything
* One day we should make it all XHTML
* everything properly escaped - prevent sql injection and cross-site scripting 
  probs
* Support Postgres 7.0 and upwards
* psql -E is a cool way of seeing how to do schema queries
* Checking out older versions of describe.c in src/bin/psql in the postgres 
  distro is a good way of seeing how to query older versions of postgres for 
  schema information
* Put functions in the highest class possible.  For instance, simple selects 
  should be in BaseDB, whereas something that works for 7.1+ should be in the 
  7.1 class.  This will minimise bugs and duplicated code.
* We primarily support Postgres, and only secondarily support MySQL, etc.
* Adhere to current coding standards
* Avoid using global variables if possible
