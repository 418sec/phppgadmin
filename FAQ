ERRORS
------

Q: I've installed phpPgAdmin but when I try to use it I get an error message
   telling me that I have not compiled proper database support into my
   PHP installation. 

A: This means that you have not properly compiled PostgreSQL support into
   your PHP.  The correct configure flag to use is '--with-pgsql'.  Read the
   PHP manual and website for more help with this.

Q: I always get "Login failed" even though I'm _sure_ I'm using the right
   username and password.

A: Check the PostgreSQL log on your server, it will give the exact reason
   why the login is failing.  Edit the pg_hba.conf file in your PostgreSQL
   data dir and make sure you have enabled access to the server properly.

Q: I can use any password to log in!

A: PostgreSQL, by default, runs in trust mode.  That means that it doesn't
   ask for passwords for local connections.  We highly recommend that you
   edit your pg_hba.conf file, and change the login type to 'md5'.  Note
   that if you change the 'local' login type to 'md5', then you might need
   to enter a password to start PostgreSQL.  Get around this by using a
   .pgpass file - explained in the PostgreSQL documentation.

Q: I'm running phpPgAdmin on Win32 and I always get the message that the
   "config.inc.php is not found".  I have copied the config.inc.php-dist file
   and yet the error still occurs.

A: On the Win32 version of PHP, there is a bug in the file_exists() function
   that means it always returns false, even when the file actually exists.  
   Disable (comment out) the file_exists() check in libraries/lib.inc.php to
   prevent the error.

Q: When I drop and re-create a table with the same name, it fails.

A: You need to drop the sequence attached to the SERIAL column of the table
   as well.  PostgreSQL 7.3 does this automatically.  If you have upgraded
   to PostgreSQL 7.3 from an earlier version, you need to run the
   contrib/adddepend script to record all dependencies.

Q: When inserting a row, what is does the 'Value' or 'Expression' box mean?

A: Choosing 'Expression' means that you can use functions, operators, other 
   field names, etc. in your value - you need to properly quote any literal 
   values yourself.  'Value' on the other hand, means that no matter what you
   enter as the value, it will be inserted as-is into the database.
