ERRORS
------

Q: I've installed phpPgAdmin but when I try to use it I get an error message
   about the "pg_connect" function not existing.

A: This means that you have not properly compiled PostgreSQL support into
   your PHP.  The correct configure flag to use is '--with-pgsql'.  Read the
   PHP manual and website for more help with this.

Q: I always get "Login failed" even though I'm _sure_ I'm using the right
   username and password.

A: Check the PostgreSQL log on your server, it will give the exact reason
   why the login is failing.  Edit the pg_hba.conf file in your PostgreSQL
   data dir and make sure you have enabled access to the server properly.

Q: I can use any password to log in!

A: PostgreSQL, by default, runs in trust mode.  That means that it doesn't
   ask for passwords for local connections.  We highly recommend that you
   edit your pg_hba.conf file, and change the login type to 'md5'.  Note
   that if you change the 'local' login type to 'md5', then you might need
   to enter a password to start PostgreSQL.  Get around this by using a
   .pgpass file - explained in the PostgreSQL documentation.

Q: I get all sorts of errors about "pg_namespace" and "schema".  What's going
   on?

A: The default database driver specified in the config.inc.php file is the
   "Postgres73" driver.  This will only work for PostgreSQL 7.3 series.
   Change this driver to "Postgres72" for the 7.2 series, "Postgres71" for the
   7.1 series or "Postgres" for 7.0.  Versions of PostgreSQL below 7.0 are not
   supported.  However, patches are welcome!

Q: I'm running phpPgAdmin on Win32 and I always get the message that the
   "config.inc.php is not found".  I have copied the config.inc.php-dist file
   and yet the error still occurs.

A: On the Win32 version of PHP, there is a bug in the file_exists() function
   that means it always returns false, even when the file actually exists.  
   Disable (comment out) the file_exists() check in libraries/lib.inc.php to
   prevent the error.
