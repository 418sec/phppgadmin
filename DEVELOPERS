DEVELOPER INFO
--------------

 phpPgAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.
 Many great features have been written by other people and you too
 can help to make phpPgAdmin a useful tool.
 
 phpPgAdmin 3.0 has its roots in the phpPgAdmin 2.4 software.  A complete 
 rewrite was necessary to support PostgreSQL 7.3 and to address problems
 in the phpPgAdmin 2.4 codebase.
 
 If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following 
 information:
 
 The following method is preferred for new developers:
  - fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
  
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin login
    [Password: ]  simply press the Enter key!
    
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co webdb
    [This will create a new sub-directory named webdb] 
    
    And you might like to get phpPgAdmin as well for reference purposes:

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co phpPgAdmin
    [This will create a new sub-directory named phpPgAdmin]
    
  - Add your stuff
  - Send us the file(s) you've modified or send us a patch (preferred).  To generate a patch, do this
    in your 'webdb' or 'phpPgAdmin' directory:

    	cvs diff -c > file.txt

    Then, just send us the file.txt

	Please note submitting code is considered a transfer of copyright to the phppgadmin project.

  Only project developers can access the CVS tree via ssh and SSH1 must 
  be installed on your client machine. 
  
  	export CVS_RSH=ssh
  	
  	login once with ssh to developername@cvs.phppgadmin.sourceforge.net to create required
  	user directories on the server.
  	
  	cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co webdb
  	cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co phpPgAdmin
  	
  Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have already
  contributed something useful to phpPgAdmin.  If you're interested in that, 
  please contact us.
