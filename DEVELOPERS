DEVELOPER INFO
--------------

 WebDB is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.
 Many great features have been written by other people and you too
 can help to make WebDB a useful tool.
 
 WebDB has its roots in the phpPgAdmin software.  A complete rewrite was
 needed for a new version of Postgres, plus also to address many deficiencies
 in the phpPgAdmin codebase.
 
 If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following 
 information:
 
 The following method is preferred for new developers:
  - fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
  
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin login
    [Password: ]  simply press the Enter key!
    
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co webdb
    [This will create a new sub-directory named webdb] 
    
    And you might like to get phpPgAdmin as well for reference purposes:

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co phpPgAdmin
    [This will create a new sub-directory named phpPgAdmin]
    
  - Add your stuff
  - Send us the file(s) you've modified or send us a patch (preferred).  To generate a patch, do this
    in your 'webdb' or 'phpPgAdmin' directory:

    	cvs diff -c > file.txt

    Then, just send us the file.txt

	Please note submitting code is considered a transfer of copyright to the phppgadmin project.

  Only project developers can access the CVS tree via ssh and SSH1 must 
  be installed on your client machine. 
  
  	export CVS_RSH=ssh
  	
  	login once with ssh to developername@cvs.phppgadmin.sourceforge.net to create required
  	user directories on the server.
  	
  	cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co webdb
  	cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phppgadmin co phpPgAdmin
  	
  Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have already
  contributed something useful to WebDB or phpPgAdmin.  If you're interested in that, 
  please contact us.
