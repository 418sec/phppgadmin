This directory contains the HTML Unicode recodings of the source
language files.  These are the actual files used by phpPgAdmin
when displaying strings.

Instructions on recoding:

UTF-8:  recode u8..html chinese.php
LATIN1: record latin1..html english.php

etc. 

After recoding, you will need to fix the <?php and ?> tags at the
top and bottom of the file.
