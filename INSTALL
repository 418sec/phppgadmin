phpPgAdmin Installation Guide
-----------------------------

1. Unpack your download

   tar -xvzf phppgadmin-*.tar.gz

2. Configure phpPgAdmin

   cp phppgadmin/conf/config.inc.php-dist phppgadmin/conf/config.inc.php

   Then edit config.inc.php and configure phgPgAdmin to your requirements.

3. Set up the reports database.

   If you want to enable reports (which are a useful feature) then go to
   the 'sql' subdirectory and view the SQL script for your database.  It
   will contain instructions on how to set up the reports database.

4. Browse to the phpPgAdmin installation using a web browser.  You must
   have cookies enabled for phpPgAdmin to work.
