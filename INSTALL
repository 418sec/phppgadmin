WebDB Installation Guide
------------------------

We have tried to code WebDB in a secure fashion, and as such it is a little
more difficult installing WebDB than phpPgAdmin.

1. Unpack your download

   tar -xvzf webdb-*.tar.gz

2. The webdb/public_html directory is the only directory that should be
   made public.  You should prevent people from browsing to any other
   directory.

3. Configure WebDB

   cp webdb/config.inc.php-dist webdb/config.inc.php

   Then edit config.inc.php and configure WebDB to your requirements.

4. Configure your PHP installation (optional)

   There are several settings you can use for optimal and more secure
   WebDB operation.  WebDB will still function regardless of these
   settings however.

   register_globals Off
   magic_quotes_gpc Off
   url_fopen Off
