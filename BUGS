fix getIndexes() and getConstraints() for < 7.3 to know about index type

re-enable help system
all DROP and ALTER commands MUST be fully schema-qualified otherwise you can accidentally drop stuff in pg_catalog :(
need icons and Find for Casts and Conversions, Languages, Aggs and OpClasses
submit changes to HTML_TreeMenu maintainer
fix constraint search to get domain and table constraints?
dump sequences when dumping tables
fix dumping clustering info

  pretty type name and schema support
