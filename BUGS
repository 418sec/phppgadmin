This file is used to track current working tasks - just ignore it!

fix getIndexes() and getConstraints() for < 7.3 to know about index type
  (eg. constraints can only be btree indexes)
re-enable help system
all DROP and ALTER commands MUST be fully schema-qualified otherwise you can accidentally drop stuff in pg_catalog :(
need icons and Find for Casts and Conversions, Languages, Aggs and OpClasses
submit changes to HTML_TreeMenu maintainer
test < 7.3 Find feature for all new objects
fix constraint search to get domain and table constraints?
dump sequences when dumping tables
fix dumping clustering info
can't edit SELECT results by oid

Need to fix:
* The getType function needs to be ported to 7.2 and 7.3 classes to add
  pretty type name and schema support
* Report login errors
* Edit Query
* Don't offer owner change feature if user is not superuser
